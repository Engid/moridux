# moridux
Redux implemented with Mori's persistent immutable data structures.

This is meant as a way for me to learn more about Mori and Redux by trying to bring them together. 

To keep things simple (and nieve), I'll do the following: <br>
-Work out of a single js file and import the libraries with script tags in the index.html page. <br>
-Use vanilla (ES5) javaScript. <br>
-Use the official toDo demo as a model. <br>


Let's have a go, shall we?
