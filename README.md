<a href="http://redux.js.org/index.html">Redux</a> implemented with <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/mori/">Mori's</a> persistent immutable data structures.

This is meant as a way for me to learn by doing. 

To keep things simple, I'll do the following: <br>
-Use the official Redux <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos">ToDo</a> demo as a model. <br>
-Start learning Redux by compiling the modular form into one js file<br>
-Learn webpack and probably start over with a fork from Redux<br>
-Realize that this is a nieve effort and not feel guilty when this project is depreciated<br>

This may end up in the bin before too long.<br>
Let's have a go, shall we?
