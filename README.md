# moridux
Redux implemented with Mori's persistent immutable data structures.

This is meant as a way for me to learn more about Mori and Redux by trying to bring them together. 

To keep things simple (and nieve), I'll do the following: 
-Work out of a single js file and import the libraries with script tags in the index.html page. 
-Use vanilla (ES5) javaScript.
-Use the official toDo demo as a model. 


Let's have a go, shall we?
