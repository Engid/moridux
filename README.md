# moridux
Redux implemented with Mori's persistent immutable data structures.

This is meant as a way for me to learn more about Mori and Redux by trying to bring them together. To keep things simple (and nieve), I'll be working out of a single js file and import the libraries with script tags in the index.html page. Maybe I'll refactor them out into modules later. Let's have a go, shall we?
